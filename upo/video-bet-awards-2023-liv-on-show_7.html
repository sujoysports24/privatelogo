The 2023 BET Awards, also known as “Culture’s Biggest Night”, airs live this weekend, and this year’s ceremony is set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.
The ceremony will kick off on Sunday, June 25, at 8 p.m. ET on BET, featuring highly-anticipated performances from pioneers and newcomers representing both the East and West Coast history of the genre from Fat Joe, Remy Ma, Chief Keef, DJ Unk, E-40, Fast Life Yungstaz & Easton (F.L.Y.) and more. GloRilla and Bel-Air’s Coco Jones, as well as other 2023 BET Awards nominees Ice Spice and Latto are also expected to hit the stage.
Patti Labelle will honor Tina Turner’s life at the BET Awards, Rolling Stone exclusively revealed Friday. No details were made available about what exactly LaBelle will perform, but a BET Awards statement said it will be “nothing short of extraordinary” and will “capture the essence of Turner’s unparalleled legacy.”

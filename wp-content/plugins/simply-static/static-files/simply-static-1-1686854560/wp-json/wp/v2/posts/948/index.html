He had stopped swimming competitively, but he stayed connected to the sport as a technical performance consultant for the university\u2019s nationally ranked swim team. Under his advisor, Ken Ono, Lu built a methodology of analyzing data from sensors worn by swimmers to improve their individual performance. By looking at an athlete\u2019s propulsion and drag data over the course of a race, Lu can advise them on where they can shave off tenths of a second simply by adjusting their stroke to be more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>That experience inspired Lu to pursue a career in other aspects of sports. At MIT he\u2019s pursuing a master\u2019s in finance to build the analytical skills necessary to enable the sustainability of sports that don\u2019t already enjoy the major commercial success of, say, football or basketball. It\u2019s especially a challenge for Olympic sports, such as swimming, which struggle for commercial ventures outside of Olympic years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy work in swimming is focused on athlete performance to win, but the definition of winning is different for a sport as a whole, and for an organization,\u201d Lu says. \u201cNot only do you need to win medals, a big part of it is how you allocate money because you also need to grow your sport.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At MIT, Lu is building a playbook for high-performance sports from both an athletic and financial perspective. He\u2019s been gaining exposure to additional elite sports by working with MIT\u2019s Sports Lab under Professor Anette \u201cPeko\u201d Hosoi. His work there isn\u2019t a requirement for his master\u2019s program, but Lu appreciates that the program\u2019s flexibility allows him time to pursue research that interests him, alongside the required curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m quite lucky to be here in the sense that MIT is known to train great people in engineering, science, or business, but also people with unique passions,\u201d says Lu. \u201cPeople that love football drafting, people that love to understand how you throw a curveball \u2014 they use their knowledge in very unexpected ways, and that\u2019s when innovation happens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lu\u2019s research with the Sports Lab focuses on optimizing strategies for aesthetic sports, such as figure skating or snowboarding, which are judged very differently than swimming is. Instead of figuring out how to move faster, athletes are interested in structuring routines that net them the most points from a panel of judges. Modelling techniques can be helpful for figuring out how to put together routines to maximize an athlete\u2019s abilities, and also to predict how a judge might assign points based on how or when a skill is demonstrated. Optimizing both athletic performance and judge psychology is a challenge, it\u2019s this type of innovation that excites him. He hopes more sporting organizations will adopt similar data-driven strategies in the future.<\/p>\n<p>When asked where he\u2019d like to end up after finishing his degree, \u201cThe sport industry is the natural choice,\u201d Lu says. Though he is certain his career will lead to sports eventually, he is still open to exploring new paths. This summer he will be a trading intern at Citadel Securities to apply the concepts learned in his degree program courses. He\u2019s also picked up sailing since coming to MIT, already reaching the highest amateur rating in under a year. Lu consistently strives for excellence, whether in himself or for those he works with.<\/p>\n<p>Since graduating from UVA, Lu has continued to work with swimmers, including national champions and Olympic medalists, as a technical performance consultant. He\u2019s also branched out into another Olympic sport, triathlon. Lu describes it as a side gig, but he\u2019s deeply invested in the athletes he works with, even taking trips to the Olympic Training Center to collect data and help them build strategies for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most fun part is actually interacting with the athletes and engaging and understanding how they think,\u201d says Lu. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to do so than others, because if you\u2019ve never swam before and you\u2019ve never trained as an elite athlete before, it\u2019s hard to understand what exactly you can and cannot do and how to communicate these things to a coach or an athlete.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Master\u2019s student Jerry Lu works to optimize the performance of both athletes and their sporting organizations. \u201cAll I<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":949,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/948"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=948"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/948\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":950,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/948\/revisions\/950"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=948"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=948"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/privatelogo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=948"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

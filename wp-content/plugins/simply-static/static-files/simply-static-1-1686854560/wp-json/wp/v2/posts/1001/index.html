One day, you have a high-performing, billion-dollar crypto; the next day, it has been reduced to ashes. Very few cryptos have consistently delivered returns, and even fewer have survived the test of time since the first crypto was launched a decade and a half ago. So, investors are always looking for cryptos with long-term potential, and TMS Network (TMSN) has proven itself to be precisely that!<\/p>\n<p>Over the past seven weeks, TMS Network (TMSN) has managed to deliver 2,300% returns to early investors. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s the seventh continuous week of positive returns for TMS Network (TMSN), beating the market in every major performance metric. Meanwhile, Optimism (OP) and Avalanche (AVAX) peaked in mid-April and have been on a steady collision course with the rock bottom since then.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TMS Network (TMSN)<\/strong><br \/>\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a blockchain-based decentralized exchange that offers both fiat and crypto assets for trading. TMS Network (TMSN) users can trade cryptos, CFDs, equities, forex, and futures on the platform. Users can buy and sell these assets using any of the 500+ cryptocurrencies supported by the platform, and need not use fiat currency for transactions. Also, no need to create accounts or perform KYC verification. CeFi users can experience the liberating freedom of DeFi for the first time with TMS Network (TMSN).<\/p>\n<p>The mind-blowing DEX has caught the attention of retail and whale investors everywhere. They believe in TMS Network\u2019s (TMSN) vision and support it with substantial investments \u2013 $6 million so far. As TMS Network (TMSN) approaches the end of its stage 4 presale, it\u2019s selling at $0.11, an absolute bargain for retail investors. Naturally, interest has been high, and TMS Network (TMSN) continues to soar in value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Optimism (OP)<\/strong><br \/>\nOptimism (OP) is a layer-2 blockchain that improves the security, and speed issues affecting Ethereum (ETH). Optimism (OP) users benefit from the proven security of Ethereum (ETH), without suffering its inefficiencies. So far, Optimism (OP) has managed to attract 100+ protocols to its platform, including the likes of Synthetix, Uniswap, and others. While Optimism (OP) has proven its viability and developers are joining the platform, it is yet to attract whale investors. In fact, the market is not so saturated with layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH) that the majority of them do not enjoy any whale investor interest. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening with Optimism (OP) too.<\/p>\n<p>Since mid-April, Optimism (OP) has lost over 50% of its value. In a last-ditch effort to salvage its value, Optimism (OP) implemented the Bedrock upgrade to treat Ethereum (ETH) as a native token in its ecosystem. Even that has failed to grab enough eyeballs to change its price direction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche (AVAX)<\/strong><br \/>\nAvalanche (AVAX) came too late, did too little differently, and has exceedingly ambitious goals that are not based in the reality of the industry. Avalanche (AVAX) intends to dislodge Ethereum (ETH) as the most preferred crypto for smart contracts. Avalanche (AVAX) hopes to achieve this by offering higher transaction speeds and superior scalability. Unfortunately for Avalanche (AVAX), the problems facing Ethereum (ETH) can be fixed with upgrades and forks. In fact, they\u2019re already working on fixing them. So, Avalanche (AVAX) will soon become a platform with no major differentiation compared to the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Fearing uncertainty, investors continue to leave the platform. Avalanche (AVAX) has lost over 35% of its value in just the last two months. The future for Avalanche (AVAX) is bleak, as its investors increasingly find their way to TMS Network (TMSN).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret that the competition in the crypto industry is brutal.
